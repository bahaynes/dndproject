# Full-Stack Application with FastAPI and Svelte

This is a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a Svelte frontend.

## Development Environment Setup

This project uses a container-based development environment powered by Docker and managed by a set of helper scripts. This is the recommended way to work on the project.

**1. Initial Setup**

First, build the development images. This command only needs to be run once, or whenever you change the dependencies in the `Containerfile.dev` files.

```bash
/app/setup.sh
```

**2. Running the Development Environment**

To start the frontend and backend services, run:

```bash
/app/run_dev.sh
```

This will start the services in the background. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and the frontend at `http://localhost:5173`.

**3. Running Tests**

To run the test suite, use the `run_tests_dev.sh` script.

```bash
# Run all tests
/app/run_tests_dev.sh

# Run only frontend tests
/app/run_tests_dev.sh --frontend

# Run only backend tests
/app/run_tests_dev.sh --backend
```

**4. Stopping the Development Environment**

To stop all running services, run:

```bash
/app/stop_dev.sh
```

## Deployment (Split Stack)

This project is configured for a "Split Stack" deployment:
- **Frontend**: Vercel
- **Backend**: Render
- **Database**: Neon (PostgreSQL)

### Environment Variables

**Backend (Render)**
The `render.yaml` blueprint handles most of these automatically.
- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for your PostgreSQL database (e.g., from Neon).
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for JWT encoding (auto-generated by blueprint).
- `ALGORITHM`: Encryption algorithm (default: `HS256`).
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`: Token expiration (default: `30`).
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: `3.11.9` (Managed via `.python-version`).

### Discord Authentication Configuration

To enable Discord Login and Multi-Tenancy, the Backend requires the following additional environment variables:

- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`: The Client ID from your Discord Developer Application. Used for OAuth2 authentication.
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`: The Client Secret from your Discord Developer Application. Used to securely exchange auth codes for tokens.
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: The Token for the associated Discord Bot. Used by the backend to fetch guild roles and verify membership server-side.
- `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI`: The callback URL for OAuth2. This must point to your **Backend API** endpoint and exactly match the redirect URI configured in the Discord Developer Portal.
  - Development: `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/discord/callback`
  - Production: `https://westmarches.bahaynes.com/api/auth/discord/callback`
- `ADMIN_DISCORD_IDS`: Comma-separated list of Discord User IDs (snowflakes) authorized to initialize new Campaigns (setup).

**Frontend (Vercel)**
You must manually set this environment variable in your Vercel Project Settings.
- `VITE_API_URL`: The full URL to your backend API.
  - Example: `https://westmarches.bahaynes.com/api`
  - Example: `https://dnd-backend.onrender.com/api`
  - **Note**: Must include the `/api` suffix.
